## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, a e machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset has been created .

# Steps followed
## Pre processed the Data
## Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
## Perform feature selection and removed unnecessary features.
## Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
## Separate the data into training and testing data.
## Tuned Model Parameters
## Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.
## Tune and compared two different classifiers.


Reporting
Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
