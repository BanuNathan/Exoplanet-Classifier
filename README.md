## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset has been created .

## Procedure
- Processed raw dataset to fit a ML-model.
- Performed big data analysis to create selection set and remove unnecessary features.
- Used a min-max scaling algorithm to scale selection set into numerically-based training and testing data.
- Tuned model parameters procedurally using grid-search methods and unique classifiers.


## Report

Two models were created using logistical and SVC models. The logistic model seems to predict better than SCV with prediction scores of 0.8426473393095556, compared to 0.8409610983981693.
