## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset has been created .

## Steps followed
</b> pre processed the Datac </b>
</b> Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.</b>
Performed feature selection and removed unnecessary features.</b>
Use dMinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.</b>
Separated the data into training and testing data.</b>
Tuned Model Parameters</b>
Used GridSearch to tune model parameters.</b>
Tuned and compared two different classifiers.</b>


Reporting

Two models were created using  LogisticRegression and SVC. LogisticRegression seems to predict better than SCV with the score of Training Data Score: 0.8426473393095556 and 
Testing Data Score: 0.8409610983981693.
